MVBouncyView
=======================================================

This project includes a simple UIView Category that can be used to add bouncing animations to your UIViews.

The category extends UIView with the following properties:

- bounceAmplitude<br/>
- bounceAttenuation<br/>
- bounceDuration<br/>

A sample application demonstrating the usage of the control is included. The component can be used in other applications simply by dragging the UIView+MVBouncing.* files into XCode.
