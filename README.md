BouncingView - Andrea Bizzotto bizz84@gmail.com

This project includes a simple UIView Category that can be used to add bouncing animations to your UIViews.

The category extends UIView with the following properties:
- bounceAmplitude
- bounceAttenuation
- bounceDuration

A sample application demonstrating the usage of the control is included. The component can be used in other applications simply by dragging the UIView+Bouncing.* files into XCode.
